# Save Water Save Money Challenge

Create a calculator that will get the inputs from the form that is already available in the index.html file and using Angular fetch the formula from the formula.json file and display a chart with the echarts script.

You can read the echarts script API here - https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts/doc/doc-en.html

The chart should display how much the user is spending in water, energy and money according to room in the house - bathroom, kitchen and outdoors.

You can use any type of JavaScript framework to get better UI.
